StockExchange v2.0dev CHANGELOG

Changes:
* Rewrote plugin to use MySQL or (if MySQL is disabled) SQLite. This should (hopefully) fix all data wipe issues, as well as provide extra functionality later on.
* When list command is used without an argument, it displays a list of length 5, instead of the top5 list.
* Cleaned up a shitload of code.
* Changed portfolio to display the price the stocks were purchased at.
* Changed it so when stocks are sold, the plugin reports if you made a profit, loss, or if you broke even.

Removals:
- Removed rollback and undo commands.
- Removed save and save-all commands.
- Removed stocks.yml file.
- Removed market and ownership files.
- Broke *most* of the API for now, until I re-write it for SQL.

Additions:
+ Added SQL support!
+ Added "all" argument to list command.
+ Added SuperPerms support.

There's probably some more but I can't remember right now.
